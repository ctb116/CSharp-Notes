This is how it works vs this is convention

How it works
namespace Models
using Models - in namespaces other than Models

Convention
You can name namespaces whatevery  you want but convention in namespaces is so to tell us something useful. 

namespace Dealership.Models 
because Models is part of the Dealership project

And then having a Models(this can be named something else) folder. Models folder for C# must be called Models but the Models namespace could be called something else.
